Nowadays, especially after the [symposium](https://www.ibg.edu.tr/hibit2019) that we attended and before the [workshop (website in Turkish)](https://turktip2019.saglik.gov.tr/) that we will attend as [a whole lab](http://pirismlab.com/) with our posters including our supervisor; I felt deeply that I need a website that introduce myself to the world. This is the perfect time to literraly say ***"Hello world!"***.

So... 

**HELLO WORLD!!**

I am Batuhan Çakır. I completed my BSc in [Bioengineering](http://www.bioeng.yildiz.edu.tr/en/) at [Yıldız Technical University](http://www.yildiz.edu.tr/). In my thesis, I prepared a literature review on effects of radiation on a human body. Later, I decided to study computationally and started my MSc in [Bioinformatics and Systems Biology](http://www.gtu.edu.tr/bioeng) at [Gebze Technical University](http://www.gtu.edu.tr/?languageId=2). During my masters, I had an Erasmus internship at Wellcome Sanger Institute in [Cellular Genetics Informatics](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/cellular-genetics-informatics) to work on benchmarking of single-cell visualization tools. Currently I am working on single-cell analyses of differentiation and reprogramming processes of stem cells.
