I am Batuhan Çakır. I completed my BSc in [Bioengineering](http://www.bioeng.yildiz.edu.tr/en/) at [Yıldız Technical University](http://www.yildiz.edu.tr/). In my thesis, I prepared a literature review on effects of radiation on a human body. Later, I continued to study computationally and started my MSc in [Bioinformatics and Systems Biology](http://www.gtu.edu.tr/bioeng) at [Gebze Technical University](http://www.gtu.edu.tr/?languageId=2). During my masters, I had an Erasmus internship at Wellcome Sanger Institute in [Cellular Genetics Informatics](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/cellular-genetics-informatics) to work on [benchmarking of single-cell visualization tools](https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqaa052). My MSc thesis is about the trajectory inference of stem cell differentiation processes by using single-cell RNAseq data. I completed my MSc in February 2021 and started to PhD in the same programme. Since January 2020, I am working as a research assistant in Department of Bioengineering at Gebze Technical University. Currently I am working simultaneously on structural bioinformatics and single-cell analyses of differentiation and reprogramming processes of stem cells.
